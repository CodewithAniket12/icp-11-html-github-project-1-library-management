       <ul> 
        <li>Workshop creativity is only for non-fiction authors</li>
        Workshop or course creativity isn’t for non-fiction authors alone. There are courses people would line up to take, from those looking to learn the mechanics of writing stories to those wanting to add to their professional arsenal of tools for the workplace. 
        <li>Successful courses, workshops, or programs should be based on the book</li>
        Workshops, courses, and programs do not have to be taught in your book to be successful. If you’ve written a book, you have marketable and transferrable skills greater than the 99% of people who have not written a book (Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics). 
        <li>Author skills are for writing books and not courses or workshops</li>
        In books workshop we are change to learn more amd more skill and have a chance to lear new thing. In book workshops we have chance to learn about how the different written write and how the think ,like how deeply they think and present it .We learn all this thing in workshop Can you spot the truth?</li>
