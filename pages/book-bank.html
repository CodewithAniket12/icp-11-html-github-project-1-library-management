            Our Library maintains a book bank mainly of undergraduate level text books to help students belonging to
            economically and socially weaker section of the society. The Book Bank Service provides long-term lending of
            textbooks and academic materials to students for an entire semester or academic year. This service ensures
            that all students, especially those in need, have access to essential study resources.
